# Final-Year-Project
The commonly known fact about hunger in the world is not shortage of food but rather
access to the food. The amount of world's food thrown in garbage is one-third of the total
food. Right now, world produces enough food to feed every person on the planet. In order
to help, we have developed an web based application that will provide a platform to the
restaurants to donate their leftovers to those in need. The main objective of this project
based on web application is to make sure to deliver leftover food by restaurant
to NGOs which will then provide it to those in need. This system consists of four modules
that are admin, NGO’s, restaurants and drivers. The majority of the population today uses
smart phones with active internet connectivity, which is the basic requirement for this
product to function properly. NGOs will send request to restaurants for food and if they
will have leftover food, they will accept request and select available rider to pick up from
restaurants. On the other hand, restaurants can also donate food by sending request to
NGO and after acceptance of request they will donate food.The IDE which we are using to build web app is visual studio code and used codeigniter 3 framework using php language
